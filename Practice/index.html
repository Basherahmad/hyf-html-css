    <p class="Cover-latter">I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the IT Project Manager position that
        your company advertised yesterday
        on the Dayjob.com website. My philosophy is that what was impossible yesterday is expected today and will be
        old-hat
        tomorrow. What separates me from others is my professionalism, technical ability, personal skills, supreme
        confidence
        and above all sheer dedication to my work. I consider myself an organized and results-focussed individual who
        is
        comfortable working at both the strategic and operational level. I pride myself on my ability to provide a
        tailored
        project management service that delivers value for money. Furthermore, I can identify, develop and initiate
        innovations
        and solutions where precedents and procedures may not exist. As you can judge from my enclosed CV I have the
        ability
        to manage stringent project budgets and resource allocation. During my career I have learnt how to provide
        professional
        project management services to a number of clients worldwide. I understand the challenges of a projects many
        complex
        inter-related processes, and am adept at steering projects efficiently through all relevant codes, regulations
        and
        legislation. At the moment I work for ......... where I provide mentoring, coaching and direction setting to
        team
        members. I manage and deliver project activity, as part of a group and work cross-functionally to solve
        problems
        and implement changes. In my role I have built up a long track record of successfully helping clients improve
        their
        project management maturity. On a personal level I am someone who knows where I am going and knows how to get
        there.
        Right now, I am keen to join a company like yours where I will work on high profile projects, and where I’ll
